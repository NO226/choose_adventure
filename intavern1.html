         as you enter the tavern you can smell some alchahol... and maybe something else? whatever it was you ignore it, taking in the scene,
         overall its a jubilent attitude with people drinking, singing and engaged in games, but then you notice theres this shady guy sitting in the corner, just staring at you?
         your tourguide cringes in concern, seemingly disliking the enviorment, but staying by your side.
         <br> what do you want to do?
